1.I would like to build a todo app, but it can't be any simple to-do app, it needs to be creative
unique, first of it's kind, give me 10 best ideas of your to build this todo ,  I want it to be related to 
influencer marketing. Give me your best 10 idea with explanation why this idea stands out.

2. Ok I like the  "Campaign Task Manager" for an Influencer Marketing Team. Now let's outline a project plan to build it with standard task scheduling, labeling status,
priorities, asssignee etc. Do websearch on unique task manager idea , take inspiration from what other people has build.

3. Ok, so I will generate the frontend with v0. Give me a complete prompt to give to v0 so that it can build a stunning and professional
frontend for our project.
4. I have added the UI frontend. Now for backend database and Authentication we will use supabase. I have already added NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY in the .env.local, include email verification on first time signup, I have already enabled email verification
in supabase and the callback url currently is localhost:3000
5. There is few problems with the UI, when I hover on any button the mouse icon should change into hand icon, which is not happening. Fix it
and also revamp the UI, the micro interaction has to be smoother, use professional color gradient and modern glass morphism effect, 
make sure of consistent spacing and typography and overall make a first class design revamp.
