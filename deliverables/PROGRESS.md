## Latest Updates (UI Revamp Complete)
**Completed comprehensive UI transformation to premium, first-class design:**

### Design System Overhaul
- Created custom glass morphism utilities with backdrop blur
- Implemented purple/pink gradient accent system
- Added custom animation keyframes (fade-in, slide-up, scale-in)
- Enhanced shadows with purple tints and glow effects
- Custom scrollbar styling with accent colors

### Component-by-Component Upgrades
1. **Authentication Pages** - Glass cards with animated gradient backgrounds, enhanced inputs
2. **AppHeader** - Glass header with gradient branding, enhanced search, premium dropdown menu
3. **TaskCard** - Glass cards with priority-based accent bars, platform icon overlays, lift animations
4. **Board & Columns** - Status-specific color coding, animated pulsing dots, gradient badges
5. **FiltersBar** - Glass design with emoji icons, active filter counter
6. **Modals & Dialogs** - Enhanced AddTaskModal, DeleteConfirmDialog with gradient styling
7. **EmptyState** - Gradient icon containers with glow effects
8. **Verify Email Page** - Premium styling matching auth pages + Suspense boundary fix

### Technical Improvements
- Fixed Next.js 16 production build (added Suspense boundaries)
- Updated all components with consistent hover states and transitions
- Implemented staggered entrance animations for better UX
- Enhanced drag-and-drop feedback with scale + rotate effects

## Next Steps
- Deploy to Vercel (production build verified ✅)
- Optional: Record walkthrough demo

## Risks & Mitigations
- v0 large-output flakiness → Mitigation: pivot to component-by-component prompts (Dashboard, TaskCard, Modal).
- Scope creep → Mitigation: lock v1 to core board + filters; defer analytics/advanced views.
- Visual consistency → Mitigation: Tailwind tokens + shadcn/ui primitives where helpful.

## Deliverable Links
- Live (Vercel): <pending>
- Repo (GitHub): <pending>
- Loom walkthrough: <optional, pending>
- v0 Prompt: ../../refined_prompt.md
- User Flow Diagram: ../planning/user-flow.md

## Decisions Log
- **Next.js 16** (App Router + Turbopack) + **Tailwind CSS 4** for modern stack
- **@hello-pangea/dnd** for accessible drag-and-drop functionality
- Frontend-first with mock client to showcase UX and velocity; Supabase integration optional
- **Premium dark-first design** with glass morphism, purple/pink gradients, and smooth animations
- **Component-level animations** for enhanced user experience (fade-in, slide-up, lift effects)
- **Suspense boundaries** for Next.js 16 compatibility with useSearchParams
- **Emoji icons** in filters/forms for visual clarity and modern feel
- **Glass card architecture** throughout for cohesive, premium aesthetic
