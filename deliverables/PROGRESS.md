# CampaignFlow — Async Progress Log

Purpose: concise, high-signal updates with links to work artifacts. No standups, just output.

## Current Status
- [x] Defined UI scope and UX for Kanban-style influencer campaign manager
- [x] v0 frontend prompt authored (see ../../refined_prompt.md)
- [x] Component architecture + data model outlined
- [x] UI generated and assembled (Next.js + Tailwind)
- [x] Mock data client with CRUD + optimistic updates
- [x] DnD with @hello-pangea/dnd across 4 columns
- [x] Search + filters (client-side)
- [x] Add/Edit/Delete flows with toasts, skeletons, empty states
- [x] Supabase auth + CRUD adapter behind env toggle
- [x] Email confirmation flow with verify + resend
- [ ] Accessibility sweep + final polish
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel + share live URL

## Today’s Updates
- Drafted and saved a comprehensive v0 prompt focused on premium CPG-brand UI polish.
- Scoped components, routes, and mock data strategy for rapid frontend assembly.
- Created deliverables folder with progress and outline docs for clear async visibility.

## Next 1–2 Hours
- Final a11y pass (focus states, labels, reduced motion)
- Vercel deploy + set env vars; confirm Supabase path end-to-end
- Record quick Loom walkthrough

## Risks & Mitigations
- v0 large-output flakiness → Mitigation: pivot to component-by-component prompts (Dashboard, TaskCard, Modal).
- Scope creep → Mitigation: lock v1 to core board + filters; defer analytics/advanced views.
- Visual consistency → Mitigation: Tailwind tokens + shadcn/ui primitives where helpful.

## Deliverable Links
- Live (Vercel): <pending>
- Repo (GitHub): <pending>
- Loom walkthrough: <optional, pending>
- v0 Prompt: ../../refined_prompt.md
- User Flow Diagram: ../planning/user-flow.md

## Decisions Log
- Next.js App Router + Tailwind + lucide + @hello-pangea/dnd for speed and DX.
- Frontend-first with mock client to showcase UX and velocity; backend wiring later.
- Dark-first design with light toggle; premium CPG aesthetic.

## Time Spent (rolling)
- Prompt + design + docs: <fill on submission>
